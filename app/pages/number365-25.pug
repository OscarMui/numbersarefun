                    Solar year is the most significant measure of time, it is the time for the Earth to make one complete rotation of the Sun, the exact time is approximately 365.2421895134 days. <br />
                    Number of days in a calendar year is set according to the solar year so that it can be used for regulating everyday life and benefit farming because they can know the exact time to plant.

                h2 Leap Year
                p.
                    In order to make it more accurate, people introduced the concept of leap year. Years with a multiple of 4 will be a leap year with 366 days.
                br
                p.
                    MATH:<br />
                    Average days in a year:<br />
                    (365+365+365+366)÷4<br />
                    =365.25 (days)<br />
                    Difference compared with the solar year:<br />
                    365.25 - 365.2422 (correct to 4 d.p.)<br />
                    = 0.0078 (days)

                p.
                    But it is not accurate enough.<br />
                    Therefore, years with a multiple of 100 is not a leap year, although it is a multiple of 4. (EG 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 are not leap years)<br />
                    And years with a multiple of 400 is a leap year, although it is a multiple of 100. (EG 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400 are leap years)

                    MATH:<br />
                    Number of leap years in 400 years:<br />
                    400÷4 (years with a multiple of 4)<br />
                    - 400÷100 (years with a multiple of 100)<br />
                    + 400÷400 (years with a multiple of 400)<br />
                    = 100 – 4 + 1<br />
                    = 97 (leap years)<br />
                    Average days in a year:<br />
                    (Number of leap year x 366 + Number of common year x 365) ÷400<br />
                    =(Number of years x 365 + Number of leap years) ÷400<br />
                    =(400 x 365 + 97) ÷400<br />
                    =146097÷400<br />
                    =365.2425 (days)<br />
                    Difference compared with the solar year:<br />
                    365.2425 - 365.24219 (correct to 5 d.p.)<br />
                    = 0.00031 (days)<br />

                    This is the error of today’s calendar system, which is very accurate.
                h2 Question 2: <br /> How many days are there from year 2001 to year 2100?
                p.
                    MATH:<br />
                    Number of leap years in 100 years:<br />
                    100÷4 -100÷100 (2100 is not a leap year)<br />
                    = 25 – 1<br />
                    = 24 (leap years)<br />
                    Days from year 2001 to year 2100:<br />
